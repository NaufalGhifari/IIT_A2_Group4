                <p><h3>Team Project Overview: UberChef</h3></p>
                
                Everyone loves a good dinner party right?  It’s a nice easy way to mix in with your colleagues, friends and family.  
                It’s a way of improving existing relationships and reconnecting with those that you care about the most.  Our group project idea is an easy way to outsource 
            it all. 
                A chef to cook in your own home from a pre-set menu, bringing all ingredients and cleaning up afterwards.  This means you can invite more people. 
                This means less stress for you and a great time for everyone.<br>
                You could even make money from hosting your own party!    Not much, depending on the amount of people.  
                But I was thinking maybe around $100 per head, minimum of six, person who’s house it is gets a cashback if everything goes smoothly.  
                So you are getting a party and meal for free!

            <div class="greenBackground">
                <h3>Win! Win! For everyone!</h3>
                
                Wait right there, I know what you are saying – it’s already available from many catering firms etc.  Yes, you are correct but it can be easier, simpler, 
                less work and less cost to host. Catering firms are for large events like weddings, conventions and large corporate events.  They can involve many hospitality
                staff also and often also include the cost of hiring all the equipment.  Also less of a personal touch.
               
                  
                Instead of just ordering off menulog. Etc you can have a fully qualified chef in your house cooking for you personally.  
                Maybe a choice of two mains, three desserts etc, all pre-ordered and paid for.  <br>
                Like a dinner party Deliveroo dude.  You don't have to 
                buy ingredients, cook while everyone is having fun, serve everyone or clean up.  Everyone also knows the menu in advance so there is limited surprises.  
                You get to be your best and look after the guests.
                Weddings, conferences, birthday parties, the list is endless.<br>
                The best thing is that it does not take much to get started.  One decent chef getting paid nicely.  
                All the cash is on a separate platform like many other services leading to greater security.<br>
                Working from a simple menu in advance for a fixed number of people can allow for partial pre-preparation.  
                All of this could be done separately under guidance from the chef.  It could go as far as including cooking demonstrations or classes 
                beforehand at an extra cost.  
                This does not even have to be meals, could be chocolate cakes, pastries,  etc.

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                
                This is to provide a way to make it easy for everyone.  The chef has a set menu of meals which are pre planned.  He basically has a full restaurant instantly. 
                The host wants everything to go well with minimal hassle.  This could even include pre party setup and presentation. <br> 
                The food could even be pre prepared to some degree before the event.  
                The chef gets recognition of his talents as he is preparing and serving right there in the house using the clients own kitchen.  
                This is an excelllent time for chefs to show off there best cuisine and introduce new cooking styles and cultures.

            <div class="greenBackground">
                <h3>Description</h3>
                
                All of this will have to be developed in partnership with qualified highly rated chefs.  I expect that initially the chef arranges all meals, 
                menus and ingredients.   
                I would expect maybe twenty dishes of which the client and party chooses two or more.  The cost would increase with more dishes selected.  
                The same could be done with the desserts, appetizers etc. <br> 
                There are rules around the serving of food of course so may have to be done in a sort of “ghost kitchen” which may be without the assistance 
                of the chef perhaps after a few trials.<br><br>
                Delivered food has become normal now.  Pizza, mc d’s, kfc, menulog, ubereats, Deliveroo etc.  But all these are missing the human connection. 
                You  may see the delivery driver at the door but that’s it.
                Look I’m not saying it’s a $12,000 wedding catering bill each time, but I’m sure people wouldn’t mind paying a few dollars more to see there food
                being cooked in front of them.  
                My wife is allergic to pepper and pepper products.  This includes capsicums, celery, etc. She can be assured the menu is safe. 
                There are vegans, muslims, all types who eat a certain diet where they can be provided for.  It may be a way to expose people to different food types also.

                <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            
                I am new to IT so am unsure of specific tools, although a basic html page and application should be fine.  
                Perhaps so you can pick which chef, which location, then drop down to a range of menus, styles, Min/Max amount of people per chef, dietary requirements, 
                times available, specials.  Perhaps in the future it could be made possible for the orders to be pre prepared offsite and delivered to the chef.  
                There are already companies like hello fresh which offer meal packs delivered.  This could fit quite well with the products they offer.  
                Although these are generally an easy to make and simpler type of meal.

            <div class="greenBackground">
                <h3>Skills Required</h3>

                First of all a good chef needs to be consulted on all of this, in order to develop menus and meals etc.  It could also be run efficiently as a two person 
                system where one does the hospitality side and the chef can simply cook.
                I think that it may be able to be run off a simple website and app.  A payment system needs to be in place also.  
                Regulations regarding the preparation of food need to be followed also.
            </div>
            <br>

            <div class="greenBackground">
                <h3>Outcome</h3>

                With a successful outcome everyone is happy.  The chef makes a good wage for one night’s work where he knows exactly what he is cooking and where.  
                The dinner party is a wonderful success and many more are being booked.  <br>
                I believe this could be so successful that people will make regular 
                fixed bookings with there friends and family.  It used to be that only the rich could afford a chef.  Now you can have one regularly once a week when you
                have a get together with the family.  You all know what's being served and the menu has been improved over time.  Imagine if there was one night a week where you 
                never need to worry about organising dinner.  <br>It is not a strictly formal setting like a wedding either.  It's a fantastic time to reconnect with family and friends.
