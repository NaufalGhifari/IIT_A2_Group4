    <p><h3>Team Project Overview</h3></p>

<p1>
<br><br>
Everyone loves a good dinner party right?  It’s a nice easy way to mix in with your colleagues, friends and family.  It’s a way of improving existing relationships and reconnecting with those that you care about the most.  My project idea is an easy way to outsource it all. A chef to cook in your own home from a pre-set menu, bringing all ingredients and cleaning up afterwards.  This means you can invite more people. This means less stress for you and a great time for everyone.
You could even make money from hosting your own party!    Not much, depending on the amount of people.  But I was thinking maybe around $100 per head, minimum of six, person who’s house it is gets a cashback if everything goes smoothly.  So you are getting a party and meal for free!  
<br><br>Win! Win! For everyone!<br><br>
Wait right there, I know what you are saying – it’s already available from many catering firms etc.  But I was just thinking of making it far easier to host.  All the cash is on a separate platform like many other services leading to greater security.  Instead of just ordering off menulog. Etc you can have a fully qualified chef in your house cooking for you personally.  Maybe a choice of two mains, three desserts etc, all pre-ordered and paid for.  Like a dinner party Deliveroo dude.
Weddings, conferences, birthday parties, the list is endless.<br>
The best thing is that it does not take much to get started.  One decent chef getting paid nicely.   Working from a simple menu in advance for a fixed number of people can allow for partial pre-preparation.  All of this could be done separately under guidance from the chef.  It could go as far as including cooking demonstrations or classes beforehand at an extra cost.  
This does not even have to be meals, could be chocolate cakes, pastries etc.  
<br><br>Motivation<br><br>
This is to provide a way to make it easy for everyone.  The chef has a set menu of meals which are pre picked.  He basically has a full restaurant instantly.  The host wants everything to go well with minimal hassle.  This could even include pre party setup and presentation.  The food could even be pre prepared to some degree before the event.  The chef gets recognition of his talents as he is preparing and serving right there in the house using the clients own kitchen.
Description
All of this will have to be developed in partnership with a qualified high rated chef.  I would expect maybe twenty dishes of which the client and party chooses two or more.  The cost would increase with more dishes selected.  The same could be done with the desserts, appetizers etc.  There are rules around the serving of food of course so may have to be done in a sort of “ghost kitchen” which may be without the assistance of the chef perhaps after a few trials.
Delivered food has become normal now.  Pizza, mc d’s, kfc, menulog, ubereats, Deliveroo etc.  But all these are missing the human connection.  You  may see the delivery driver at the door but that’s it.
Look I’m not saying it’s a $12,000 wedding catering bill each time, but I’m sure people wouldn’t mind paying a few dollars more to see there food being cooked in front of them.  My wife is allergic to pepper and pepper products.  This includes capsicums, celery, etc.  There are vegans, muslims, all types who eat a certain diet where they can be provided for.  It may be a way to expose people to different food types also.
Tools and Technologies

I am new to IT so am unsure of specific tools, although a basic html page should be fine.  Perhaps so you can pick which chef, which locatyion, then drop down to a range of menus, styles, Min/Max amount of people per chef, dietary requirements, times available, specials.  Perhaps in the future it could be made possible for the orders to be pre prepared offsite and delivered to the chef.  There are already companies like hello fresh which offer meal packs delivered.  This could fit quite well with the products they offer.  Although these are generally an easy to make and simpler type of meal.

<br><br>Skills Required<br><br>
First of all a good chef needs to be consulted on all of this, in order to develop menus and meals etc.  I think that it may be able to be run off a simple website and app.  A payment system needs to be in place also.  Regulations regarding the preparation of food need to be followed also.


<br><br>Outcome<br><br>
With a successful outcome everyone is happy.  The chef makes a good wage for one night’s work.  The dinner party is a wonderful success and many more are being booked.  This could work well in other poorer parts of the world also.
