                <p>After taking the Myers-Briggs test, I got the following result: INTP-T Logician.</p>

                <img style="border-radius: 10px;" src="../Personal Info/Naufal/Test_pic_01.png" alt="Cool picture did not load :(" width="550" />

                <p>Key points of my personality according to the test are:
                <ul>-	Introverted: Prefers solitary activities and get exhausted by social interaction.</ul>
                <ul>-	Intuitive: Intuitive individuals are very imaginative, open-minded and curious.</ul>
                <ul>-	Thinking: Thinking individuals focus on objectivity and rationality, prioritizing logic over emotions.</ul>
                <ul>-	Prospecting: Prospecting individuals are very good at improvising and spotting opportunities.</ul>
                <ul>-	Turbulent: Likely to experience a wide range of emotions and to be success-driven, perfectionistic and eager to improve.</ul></p>
                
                <p>They do have good points that I mostly agree upon such as introverted and intuitive. However, some others I have difficulties relating to such as brain driven decision making. I tend to be rational of course, but I believe that I am more emotional than how the result make it seem.<br>
                    But again, it is an online test (not a more precise personal test) so safe to say that it is pretty good for what it is.</p>

                <p>After taking an online test aimed to find one's best learning style, here is the result:

                <ul>Auditory: 10%</ul>
                <ul>Visual: 55%</ul>
                <ul>Tactile: 35%</ul>

                According to the test, I am mostly a visual learner. As I have thought about it previously, I can say that I very much agree with the result. I found that learning something visually is really helpful for me as I retain pictures more than text or audio.</p>

                <p>The test would give a rating based on 5 aspects abbreviated OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Here is the result of my test:</p>

                <ul>O -> 73%</ul>
                <ul>C -> 54%</ul>
                <ul>E -> 27%</ul>
                <ul>A -> 67%</ul>
                <ul>N -> 73%</ul>

                <p>To summarize briefly, according to this test my Openness score is very high which means that I tend to be more creative and imaginative than other that have taken the test. Similarly, to Myers-Briggs test, I am more reserved/less extroverted than most people which means I have to put effort to maintain a good communication with others, which is very important especially in a group.
