            <h3>Analysis: </h3>
            <h3>Cyber security</h3>
            <p>Three of our group members have indicated cyber security jobs. This is in line with the IT industry trend.
               According to Burning Glass Technologies (2019b), since 2013, the number of cybersecurity job listings has
               increased by 94% in the US, compared to only 30% for all IT positions. This is more than three times the rate
               of the whole IT market. Cybersecurity positions make for 13% of all information technology positions. Cybersecurity
               roles, on the other hand, take 20 percent longer to fill than other IT jobs and pay 16 percent more. This amounts
               to more than U$12,700 per year on average.</p>
            
            <p>Kaspersky defines that the technique of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks,
               and data from hostile intrusions is known as cyber security. It is also known as electronic information security or
               information technology security. The phrase is used in a range of contexts, ranging from business to mobile computing,
               and it may be broken down into a few categories such as network, application, information, operation, information and
               operational security, disaster recovery and business continuity, and end-user education.</p>
            
            <p>In accordance with the spread of IT equipment, it is clear that the demand of cyber security has been increasing to
               protect users from potential cyber threats. Without sufficient implementation of cyber security, it would be hard to
               grow the IT industry further, as users wish to be assured for cyber security when they use IT equipment.</p><br>
            
            <h3>Data science</h3>
            <p>The remaining one member has selected a data scientist job, which also corresponds to the industry trend. A research
               by Burning Glass Technologies (2019a) shows that over the last five years, demand for data scientists and data engineers
               in the UK has increased by 231 percent. According to the research "Dynamics of data science skills," this is far faster
               than general job postings in the UK, which increased by 36%.</p>
            
            <p>According to IBM (2020), to unearth and explain the business insights buried in data, data scientists use the scientific
               method, arithmetic and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling. As such, data
               scientists require computer science and pure science skills in addition to those required of standard data analysts. The
               specific skills required for data scientists include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Application of mathematics, statistics and scientific methods to solve problems</li>
                <li>For reviewing and preparing data, using a variety of tools and approaches, ranging from SQL to data mining to data
                    integration methods</li>
                <li>Predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning models, are used
                    to extract insights from data</li>
                <li>Creating applications to automate data processing and calculations</li>
                <li>Interpreting and describing stories that effectively communicate the meaning of results to decision-makers and
                    stakeholders at all levels of technical expertise</li>
                <li>Explain how these findings can be applied to business issues</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>As mentioned in the cyber security section, due to the huge increase of data, companies have problems with sorting and
               analysing data. Also, data-driven decision making becomes more common for companies in any industries, because analytics
               and findings by data scientists would be more beneficial for decision making than analyses by traditional financial/data
               analysts. As such, the demand of data scientists has been growing regardless of the industry. However, as data science
               requires IT skills as well as mathematics and statistical knowledge. Such skilled resources are in short in the job market,
               because previously IT engineers and mathematicians/statisticians are two different jobs.</p><br>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Cyber security is essential for users of information technologies. Due to advancement and spread of information technologies,
               it is difficult to live without IT equipment such as computers, smartphones, IOT devices and so on. Also, users provide their
               data to service providers, which is used for statistical analysis for better user experience. However, the popularization of
               IT equipment and huge increase of their data may expose them to potential cyber threats. The demand of cyber security has been
               increasing to minimise such risks. The selections by the three group members are substantiated by the robust market demand.</p>
            
            <p>Owing to the drastic increment of data, the demand for data scientists rises in the job market. Their analyses would be helpful
               for decision making in any industries, because the analyses would be able to uncover and explain business insights buried in data,
               although supply of candidates for data scientists are insufficient.</p>

            <p>It is revealed that our ideal jobs correspond to the IT industry trends created by the advancement of IT technologies. Therefore,
               it would be necessary for us to catch up with and learn the latest IT technologies to successfully find our ideal jobs in the IT
               industry.</p>
