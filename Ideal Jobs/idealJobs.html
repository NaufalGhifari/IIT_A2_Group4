            <h3>Analysis: </h3>
            <p>Three of our group members have indicated cyber security jobs. This is in line with the IT industry trend. 
            According to Burning Glass Technologies (2019), since 2013, the number of cybersecurity job listings has 
            increased by 94% in the US, compared to only 30% for all IT positions. This is more than three times the rate 
            of the whole IT market. Cybersecurity positions make for 13% of all information technology positions. Cybersecurity 
            roles, on the other hand, take 20 percent longer to fill than other IT jobs and pay 16 percent more. This amounts 
            to more than U$12,700 per year on average.</p>

            <p>One member selected a data scientist job, which also correspond to the industry trend. A research by Burning Glass 
            Technologies (2019) shows that over the last five years, demand for data scientists and data engineers in the UK has 
            increased by 231 percent. According to the research "Dynamics of data science skills," this is far faster than general 
            job postings in the UK, which increased by 36%.</p>
