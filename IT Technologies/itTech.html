                <p><h3>What does it do?</h3></p>
                <p><h3>Clouds, services, servers</h3></p>
                <p>IBM Cloud Education (2019) defines that a cloud server is a strong physical or virtual infrastructure that stores and processes applications and data.
                Cloud servers are formed by dividing a physical (bare metal) server into numerous virtual servers using virtualization software.</p>

                <p>There are 3 types of cloud services such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (Paas) and software as a service
                (SaaS). In IaaS, clients can rent storage, networking, servers, and other computer resources in the cloud on a pay-as-you-go basis from
                a vendor. Next, under PaaS, users can build and deliver apps using a cloud-based environment provided by a service provider. The infrastructure
                is provided by the provider. Lastly, software and apps are delivered by a service provider in SaaS (IBM Cloud Education 2018).</p><br/>

                <p><h3>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h3></p>
                <p>Ashford & Schmidt (2020) defines that cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital currencies, substantiated by blockchain technologies.
                Cryptocurrencies includes Bitcoin, Ethereum and more than five thousand types of cryptocurrencies. In a peer-to-peer network,
                a blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions in which participants are able to confirm transactions without central authorities
                (PricewaterhouseCoopers n.d.).<br><br>
                    Users of cryptocurrencies manage and maintain the value of cryptocurrencies on the internet. Unlike fiat currencies
                such as the U.S dollar or the Euro, central authorities do not control cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, encrypted and digital
                (Ashford & Schmidt 2020). Through cryptocurrency mining, users’ transactions are verified and added the public ledger, blockchain, and new coins are
                minted into the existing circulating supply. These processes substantiate cryptocurrencies to function as a peer-to-peer decentralized network
                without central authorities (Binance Academy 2018).</p><br/>

                <p><h3>Machine learning</h3></p>
                <p>Machine learning is a subset of computer science and artificial intelligence focusing on the usage of algorithms and data to mimic the method which
                human beings study and improve their accuracy (IBM Cloud Education 2020b). Machine learning is a technological instrument which functions in the idea
                which a computer is able to study information without human intervention. Using algorithms, machine learning examines huge amount of information or
                find unique patterns of data. Based on analysis of these patterns, it categorizes them and provide predictions. In traditional machine learning, a
                computer studies ways to decrypt information categorized by humans. As such, machine learning is a system which studies from datasets labeled by humans
                (Trend Micro n.d.).</p><br/>

                <p><h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3></p>
                <p>Autonomous vehicles are cars which are able to drive themselves from a departure point to a destination in autopilot mode with a variety of in-vehicle
                technologies and sensors such as adaptive cruise control, active steering, anti-lock braking systems, GPS navigation technologies, lasers and radar
                (Gartner n.d.). <br><br>
                    There are five levels of driving automation starting without automation and ends with completely autonomous vehicles. If a vehicle falls
                under level zero, level one or level two, its driver needs to control systems, a proactive and engaged driving is necessary. If a vehicle possesses Level 3,
                Level 4, or Level 5 autonomous driving systems in the future, the technology will assume entire control of the driving without the need for human intervention.
                If the car warns the driver and requires that she take charge of the vehicle, she must be ready and can do so (Choksey & Wardlaw 2021).</p><br/>

                <p><h3>What is the likely impact?</h3></p>
                <p><h3>Clouds, services, servers</h3></p>
                <p>Contrary to the three types of cloud services, most companies used to deploy a server in the same location as their companies. It is costly and inefficient
                to install a server in their own companies, while cloud service is inexpensive and flexible. Most cloud service companies provide monthly payment contracts
                including backup, support, maintenance, and upgrades. Also, depending on the size of companies, clients can change the capacity of servers, and compared to
                on-premise servers, which must be installed on a physical server, cloud server can be deployed on the Internet.</p><br/>

                <p><h3>Block chain and cryptocurrencies</h3></p>
                <p>Blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies are able to execute transactions between untrusted parties in public ledgers without support by middlemen. In
                a public ledger which no one controls, blockchain technologies are able to provide financial services such as securitization and payments without financial
                institutions (CBInsights 2021). This will fundamentally change financial services which are currently almost oligopolized by financial institutions.</p><br/>

                <p><h3>Machine learning</h3></p>
                <p>In the current big data life, machine learning would be beneficial. For example, it provide benefits including recognizing voice command on our mobiles,
                recommending songs on Spotify or items to buy next on Amazon, and suggesting shortest way to get to our destination on Waze (Trend Micro n.d.). Also, image
                recognition is one of the examples of machining learning. By learning huge volume of handwriting, machine learning is able to recognize letters and execute
                a program.</p><br/>

                <p><h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3></p>
                <p>According to Marr (2020), we could see a significant drop in emissions in the future, with the bulk of self-driving vehicles being electric or hybrid, and
                since autonomous vehicles drive more efficiently than people. Based on a research from the University of California, Davis, automated vehicles might reduce
                greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% by 2050, if the vehicles are electric and shared. If we do not make the move to more shared automobiles, the alarming
                projection is that emissions will rise.</p>
                <p>As such, not only developing autonomous vehicles but promoting electric vehicles and car sharing would be necessary to drop greenhouse gas emissions. Otherwise,
                autonomous vehicles may cause adverse effects for the environment.</p><br/>

                <p><h3>How will this affect you?</h3></p>
                <p><h3>Clouds, services, servers</h3></p>
                <p>SaaS would be beneficial for individual users. For example, Gmail does not require to install software, its users can access it on a web browser, and maintenance
                and upgrade are provided for free and executed at the cloud server side. Users do not have to do that by themselves. On the other hand, traditional software
                requires to install software and sometimes charge additional fees for upgrade. As users of traditional software need to implement installation and upgrade by
                themselves, they need to spend time for deployment and upgrading.</p><br/>

                <p><h3>Block chain and cryptocurrencies</h3></p>
                <p>Some cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Litecoin have supply caps. For example, bitcoin’s supply cap is 21 million. That means bitcoin will not be newly minted
                beyond 21 million coins (Kim 2021). After all the coins are minted, bitcoin mining will be rewarded with transaction fees by bitcoin users. This is totally
                different from fiat currencies controlled by central banks for inflation or deflation. In an inflation economy, the value of our fiat currency decrease, but if we
                convert fiat currency to a cryptocurrency with a supply cap, it will be possible to avoid such a risk of inflation.</p><br/>

                <p><h3>Machine learning</h3></p>
                <p>As mentioned in the impact by machine learning, it can learn our preferences or patterns, so it suggests what we prefer or looking for. That would be convenient
                for us rather than manually select commands, songs, and items. On top of that, machine learning continuously improve accuracy to bring better recognition or
                suggestion. The more we use machine learning, the better it will be improved.</p><br/>

                <p><h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3></p>
                <p>Marr (2020) states that while there have been a few high-profile incidents of self-driving cars being engaged in terrible fatal accidents, research suggests that
                self-driving cars will make our roadways safer in the long run.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to for humans to concentrate on driving for a long time because of fatigue, unclear sight at night and so on. Autonomous driving would not have
                such problems as it is run by computers. It is suggested to introduce autonomous driving to the logistic industry, which has had a problem with unsafe driving for a long time.</p>
